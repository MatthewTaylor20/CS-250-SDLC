**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

I think that the biggest thing that is important with interpreting and impementing user needs is to decompose the problems they present. User stories helps with this because the user stories are a clearly defined structure for doing just that. The format of user stories make it very easy to think about the problems in a way that is easy to understand and to set clear goals. 

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

The biggest habit that I have been trying to develop is to decompose the problems presented to me into smaller problems that I know how to solve. It becomes very difficult to solve one giant problem rather than many small problems. The user stories that we used in this agile process really helps to accomplish that and I would like to continue to use that in future development work. 

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

Ultimately I believe that being a good team member in software development comes down to two main things. The first thing is to make sure that you are communicating clearly with your teammates. Agile and scrum seemed to be really great ways to make sure that that is happening. The second thing that I think is important is to make sure that you are meeting deadlines. If you are constantly falling behind on deadlines then the rest of your team can't really depend on you.
